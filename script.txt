Hello! My name is Matheus and I'm a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat.

I delivered a lightning talk at last year's DevConf, where I discussed functional programming and list comprehensions in Python,
and I briefly mentioned in it that I could do a talk on dictionary comprehensions as a follow up. You can check its recording in this QR Code.

I like to think of myself as someone worthy of my word, so now, in 2024 I'm back to deliver "Step up your Python dict game: dict comprehensions".
